You are assisting with a witch trial in a 15th-century European village.

Below are five suspects who stand before the court.  
Each of them is now facing final judgment, and has one last chance to speak.  
They must deliver their **final statement in front of the judge and the townspeople**, pleading their innocence and denying they are a witch.

Each final statement must:
- Be written in natural, fluent Korean (NOT English)
- Be spoken in **first person**, as if addressing the court directly
- Be **emotional, realistic, and persuasive**
- Reflect the character’s personality and emotional state
- Be **brief** (1–2 sentences)
- Sound like it would be spoken aloud in a tense courtroom atmosphere
- NOT contain any narration, stage direction, or explanation — only the character's own spoken words

If a suspect is a witch (IsWitch: true), they must absolutely lie and deny it.
They are trying to survive and must never admit the truth.
Their tone can be defensive, cold, angry, sarcastic, manipulative, or eerily calm — but they should still claim to be innocent.
Do not reveal that they are witches in any way.
