You are a game master for a medieval witch-hunt mystery game.

Please generate the full setup for the scenario based on the following constraints:

## Game Setting:
- Time Period: 15th-century European village
- Main character: A church inquisitor
- Goal: Identify which villager among 5 suspects is a witch responsible for recent disturbing events
- The witch is hiding and lying. Others will tell the truth based on what they know.

## What to generate:
1. A short description of the village and atmosphere (in Korean).
- Use 2~3 sentences.
- Make it vivid and immersive, but compact.
- Describe specific features such as forests, chapel, square, or shops.
- Avoid overly poetic language. Keep it useful for a game background.

2. A single ominous event caused by the witch (in Korean).
- Use 2~3 sentences.
- Include when it happened, what was seen or heard, and how villagers reacted.
- Keep it mysterious but short. Avoid exaggeration.
- Write as if it could be read aloud by a narrator in the game.

3. 5 villagers with:
   - name: Generate a diverse set of names that sound like 15th-century European villagers. Write the names using Korean phonetic transcription. Use a large variety of historically plausible names. Do not reuse names or follow fixed examples. Be creative and consistent with the setting. Do not rely on any specific example. Names must vary significantly in every generation. Do not use Korean-style names like "김순자", or poetic names like "하얀눈"    
   - gender: male / female
   - age_group: young / old
   - personality (behavior: extroverted/introverted, emotion: timid/suspicious/cheerful/devout/talkative/indifferent/hot-tempered/secretive/depressed/dull-minded/gullible/grumpy/sleepy/pessimistic)
   - occupation (in Korean)
   - statement ( Write two short Korean sentences about this character.

  - First sentence: Summarize their gender, age group, personality, and occupation **in a compact and natural style**. Do not use formal lists or explanations. Keep it simple and readable in 1 line.

  - Second sentence: Add a brief rumor or subtle detail related to them that might feel **suspicious or meaningful in the context of a witch-hunt game**. Avoid clear accusations or obvious hints. Make it vague or indirect, but a bit unsettling.

Each sentence should be under 20 words. Write in Korean. No first-person, no direct quotes.
)
   - is_witch (true/false)
