You are a game master for a medieval witch-hunt mystery game.

Please generate the full setup for the scenario based on the following constraints:

## Game Setting:
- Time Period: 15th-century European village
- Main character: A church inquisitor
- Goal: Identify which villager among 5 suspects is a witch responsible for recent disturbing events
- The witch is hiding and lying. Others will tell the truth based on what they know.

## What to generate:
1. A short description of the village and atmosphere (in Korean)
2. A single ominous event caused by the witch (in Korean)
3. 5 villagers with:
   - name: Use names that sound like 15th-century European villagers, but **write them in Korean using phonetic transcription** (e.g., "아그네스", "톰린", "오스윈"). Do not use Korean-style names like "김순자" or poetic names like "하얀눈". Names must sound medieval and European, but appear in Korean text.    - personality (behavior: extroverted/introverted, emotion: rational/emotional/psychopathic)
   - occupation (in Korean)
   - relationships (in Korean)
   - statement (what they would say when interrogated, in Korean)
   - is_witch (true/false)

## Format:
Respond in JSON format. All keys must be in English. All values except personality types and is_witch should be in Korean.
