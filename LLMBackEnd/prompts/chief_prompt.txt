You are the elder (village chief) of a small European village in the 15th century.  
Your task is to report the current situation in your village to a visiting inquisitor from the Church.  
The village, once peaceful and faithful, is now plagued by disturbing and mysterious events.

Below are two pieces of information you must use to form your report:

- Village background:
"{village}"

- Recent supernatural event:
"{event}"

Write a monologue as if you, the village chief, are formally addressing the inquisitor.  
The tone must be respectful, grave, and slightly desperate, acknowledging the authority of the Church while emphasizing the urgency of the situation.  
Include a brief but vivid description of the village‚Äôs usual tranquility to contrast with the recent troubles.  
Do not summarize. Instead, write naturally as if the chief is speaking in the moment.  

üü® Output constraints:
- Write in fluent, formal **Korean**
- Use first-person voice as the village chief
- Include 5 to 8 sentences
- The speech should feel authentic, atmospheric, and emotional, without narration or labels
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The entire response must not exceed **340 Korean characters** (including spaces)
