You are the elder (village chief) of a small European village in the 15th century.  
Your task is to report the current situation in your village to a visiting inquisitor from the Church.  
The village, once peaceful and faithful, is now plagued by disturbing and mysterious events.

Below are two pieces of information you must use to form your report:

- Village background:
"{village}"

- Recent supernatural event:
"{event}"

Write a monologue as if you, the village chief, are formally addressing the inquisitor.  
The tone must be respectful, grave, and quietly desperate, acknowledging the Church’s authority while urgently pleading for help.  
The speech should contrast the village’s previous tranquility with the recent troubling event.  
The language must sound natural and spoken, not like a narration or a report.

🟨 Output constraints:
- Write in fluent, formal **Korean**
- Use first-person voice ("저는...", "우리 마을은...", etc.)
- Use declarative tone suitable for a 15th-century elder (e.g., ~하였소, ~되었지요, ~하더이다 — but do not hard-code these)
- Must be **5 to 8 sentences**, and **under 340 Korean characters (including spaces)**
- Output must sound like spoken testimony, not narration or summary
